# solar-plant-data-api
 This repository contains a Python-based REST API built using FastAPI to expose solar plant data. The API allows querying of data based on time ranges and specific environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover, etc. The repository also includes a Dockerfile to package the API into a Docker container for easy deployment.
